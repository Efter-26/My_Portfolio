        Hello, I am a passionate Software Engineer currently working at Better E-Mart, where I build and maintain scalable web applications from front to back. I work with technologies like React.js/ Next.js, Node.js/ Express.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS to deliver seamless user experiences and efficient backend systems. I focus on creating smooth user experiences, implementing secure and efficient architectures, and constantly optimizing performance. Whether itâ€™s a dynamic admin dashboard, real-time data handling, or automating manual workflows, I love turning ideas into functional, production-ready solutions.
